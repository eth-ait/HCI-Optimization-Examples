    "A genetic algorithm is a type of evolutionary strategy (ES). We will apply biological inspired operations to a problem. In our case we have 7 zoom participants. However some are more important than others. Given that you want to show as many important people as possible, but the cognitive cost increases. Who should you show? In general this method outperforms random search on bigger problems, where exhaustive search is infeasible.\n",
